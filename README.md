# CointMU Desktop Client

CointMU Desktop Client is a robust Proof of Work blockchain node bundled within a secure and high-performance Electron application. It provides users with an integrated dashboard for monitoring node metrics, controlling the miner, and interacting with the CointMU network seamlessly.

It runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v22 or higher recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- Git
- A `geth` binary placed in the `resources/bin/` directory (`geth.exe` on Windows, `geth` on Linux and macOS)

### Installation (from source)
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kakonoomoidee/CointMU.git
   cd CointMU
   ```
2. Place the platform-appropriate `geth` binary in `resources/bin/`. On Linux and macOS, make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x resources/bin/geth
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables in `.env` based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Building Distributables

The application is packaged with electron-builder. Each command builds the installer for
the host operating system. Build Windows artifacts on Windows, Linux artifacts on Linux,
and macOS artifacts on macOS.

### Windows
```bash
npm run build:win
```
Produces a Windows installer in the `dist/` directory.

### Linux
```bash
npm run build:linux
```
Produces Linux packages (such as AppImage or deb) in the `dist/` directory.

### macOS
```bash
npm run build:mac
```
Produces a macOS application and DMG in the `dist/` directory.

Continuous integration builds all three platforms automatically through the GitHub Actions
release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) whenever a `v*` tag is pushed.

## Development Workflow

### Using the Makefile
We provide a professional build system via `Makefile` to streamline development tasks. The available commands are:

- `make dev`: Starts the development server with hot-module reloading for both the main process and the React renderer.
- `make build:win`: Compiles the application and packages it as a Windows executable.
- `make clean`: Removes all build artifacts, including `out`, `dist`, and `build` directories to ensure a fresh compilation state.
- `make help` (default): Displays the list of available commands.

### Release Workflow
Releasing a new version is fully automated using our custom bump-version script. This script synchronizes the version string across both `package.json` and the `Makefile`, installs dependencies, creates a versioned git commit, applies an annotated git tag, and pushes the updates to the remote repository.

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/bump-version.js <major|minor|patch> [prerelease-tag]
```

**Examples:**
- Bump the minor version (e.g., from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0):
  ```bash
  node scripts/bump-version.js minor
  ```
- Bump the patch version with a prerelease tag (e.g., to 1.1.1-beta):
  ```bash
  node scripts/bump-version.js patch beta
  ```
